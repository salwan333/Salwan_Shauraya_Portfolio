   * Home  
   * Projects

   This section introduces the portfolio and includes an 'About Me' segment that details my experience, background, and skill set in motion, graphics, and web design. I will also feature testimonials and team projects, alongside hyperlinks to my most recent work. At the bottom of this section, users can download my resume for more detailed information about my professional background and skills. The hero image will feature a scroll-based GreenSock animation using CSS, adding an engaging visual element as users navigate.

4. User Experience Enhancements 
   GreenSock animations will enhance user experience, making the portfolio visually appealing with dynamic scroll effects and hover animations.

5. Projects 
   This section showcases my work using JavaScript, with grid CSS and SCSS for styling. A unique feature is the dynamic display of project descriptions, allowing for a seamless user experience. Users can click on individual projects to access detailed case studies. Additionally, there will be a demo reel in my custom-coded video player, featuring an entertaining video of all my best projects.

6. Purpose
   The purpose of my portfolio website is to showcase my abilities and work in an eye-catching, polished, and visually appealing way. It's the pinnacle of functionality and design, fusing state-of-the-art design with sophisticated aesthetics to create an engaging and educational online presence.
