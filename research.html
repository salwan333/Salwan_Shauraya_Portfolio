            <h2>Case Study: Rebranding Zima</h2>
            <p>Hello! This is a project in which we were assigned to rebrand Zima, and it turned out to be an exciting creative journey. My partner, Divij Saddul, and I started by brainstorming ideas for a fresh visual identity that captures the spirit of the brand. We designed a new logo and created wireframes to map out our vision.</p>
            <p>Using Cinema 4D, we crafted model cans and wrapped the packaging around them to give everything a modern, appealing look. To really bring our designs to life, we produced a dynamic 3D animation for promotional videos that highlights the new branding in an engaging way.</p>
            <p>On top of that, we built a complete website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring it offers a smooth and enjoyable experience for users. This project not only sharpened our design and coding skills but also showed us how important it is to have a cohesive brand presence across different platforms. Overall, it was a fantastic opportunity to collaborate and bring something new to life!</p>
