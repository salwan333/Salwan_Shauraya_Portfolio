        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
            My partner and I created a Music Mixer app that lets users mix different music styles like Phonk, Lo-Fi, and Synthwave. The app has an easy-to-use design where users can drag and drop tracks, layer beats, and add effects like reverb and distortion.

        <h2>Challenge & Solution</h2>
        
        <h3>Problem: Laptop Issues</h3>
        <p>
            My laptop kept crashing while working on this project, which made it hard to test and complete the app on time.
        </p>
        <h4>Solution:</h4>
        <p>
            To keep the project moving, I used the school's computers, which worked better and allowed me to finish testing and development without interruptions.
